# Activity Data APIs

These APIs allow us to search for a particular pattern or group of patterns that occur on the query string of the on-page url. 
The search APIs give us the ability to look at the following characterstics about a patterns:

- URLs: these are the URLs that match the pattern
- UIDs: these are the UIDs that match the pattern
- Count: this gives us a summary about the pattern
- Timeseries: this gives us a timeseries summary about how the pattern changes over time
